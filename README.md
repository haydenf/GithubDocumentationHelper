# Github Documentation Helper
This repo is made as a learning resource that can show you how to understand &amp; write better documentation for your projects.


## Why does this matter? 
Documentation makes it easier for everyone to understand several things about your work, such as:
* What your code currently does
* What you want your code to do in the future 
* What issues you or others may be having with your code
* Who is working on your project
* what features, files, issues, etc, need work 

## How does Github documentation work? 
Github has different types of documentation in different parts of your repository. Not every Github repository needs every type of documentation, but here's a few of the common types:

### Markdown files
The most-common type of documentation in a Github repository. Markdown files are identified by the file extension ```.md``` and use a style of syntax similar to HTML and "BBCode" - though in Github, some HTML will work directly in the markdown files as well.


### Github repo wikis
The "wiki" section of a repository is a great place for you to store detailed information about your repository - it's basically your own, project-specific Wikipedia. This is especially useful in larger apps, where you can cover things like how to use your app's API or why certain features are structured in a certain way.

With a wiki, it's treated as a separate repository to the rest of your codebase. You can clone your wiki down to your computer and edit it easily - but you must create the first page of the wiki on the Github website page of your repository before you can clone it or edit it.
So this means you'd end up with two repos:
* Project.git
* Project.wiki.git

### Github repo projects
Have you ever used Trello? Or kanban boards in general? It's that, but built into your repository. 

You can automate the columns here - click on the three-dot menu on a column and select "Manage Automation". You can set it up so that new issues automatically create tasks in the Project tab, and do things like automatically move tasks to a "Done" column when the pull request is merged or issue is closed. It's basically like a Github integration for Trello, but contained entirely within Github!
