# Github Documentation Helper
This repo is made as a learning resource that can show you how to understand &amp; write better documentation for your projects.


## Why does this matter? 
Documentation makes it easier for everyone to understand several things about your work, such as:
* What your code currently does
* What you want your code to do in the future 
* What issues you or others may be having with your code
* Who is working on your project
* what features, files, issues, etc, need work 

## How does Github documentation work? 
Github has different types of documentation in different parts of your repository. Not every Github repository needs every type of documentation, but here's a few of the common types:

### Markdown files
The most-common type of documentation in a Github repository. Markdown files are identified by the file extension ```.md``` and use a style of syntax similar to HTML and "BBCode" - though in Github, some HTML will work directly in the markdown files as well.
